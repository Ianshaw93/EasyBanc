# EasyBanc
Facial recognition module for a banking app made within 48hr period during a fintech hackathon.  

Youtube demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m8h8OIUds&ab_channel=ShawOnTech

This GitHub contains a lightweight GUI made in TKinter for demo purposes and the FR module only. I do not own the original codebase which included ReactNative.  

Coded using Python; originally integrated into app using ReactNative; app tested using Android Studio; version control using GitLab.

# How it Works:
* User registers credentials

* 300 photos are taken of the user's face are taken to train the classifier.  The following photo shows myself being recognised following training on my face.

* At login face is recognised and user logins into banking app.
